                <h2>What is doodls.fun?</h2>
                <p>A free online multiplayer drawing and guessing game where you compete for SOL prizes. Players take turns drawing words while others guess to earn points. The player with the most points wins! 100% of creator fees from the $doodl coin go directly into prize pools, so you can play for free and compete for real prizes.</p>
                
                <h2>How do I play?</h2>
                <p>Simply enter your name, choose an avatar, and click "Play!" to join a public game. When it's your turn, choose a word to draw. Other players will try to guess what you're drawing. When it's not your turn, try to guess what others are drawing. Score the most points to win!</p>
                
                <h2>Do I need to pay to play?</h2>
                <p>No! doodls.fun is completely free to play. You don't need to put any money in. All prizes come from creator fees generated by the $doodl coin.</p>
                
                <h2>How do prize pools work?</h2>
                <p>Multiple public games run simultaneously. When games finish, creator fees from the $doodl coin are automatically claimed and split equally across each active lobby. Winners (1st, 2nd, and 3rd place) can claim their SOL prizes directly to their connected wallet.</p>
                
                <h2>How are rewards distributed?</h2>
                <p>When a game finishes, creator fees are automatically split equally across all active lobbies. Then:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1st place:</strong> Receives the largest share of the prize pool</li>
                    <li><strong>2nd place:</strong> Receives the second-largest share</li>
                    <li><strong>3rd place:</strong> Receives the third-largest share</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Winners can claim their SOL prizes directly to their connected wallet.</p>
                
                <h2>Do I need to connect a wallet?</h2>
                <p>Wallet connection is optional for basic gameplay. However, to claim SOL prizes, you'll need to connect your wallet. We use Privy, a trusted and secure wallet connection service. We don't have access to your wallet information.</p>
                
                <h2>What is the token holder head start?</h2>
                <p>Players who hold $doodl tokens may receive a small head start in points at the beginning of games. This advantage is designed to be fair and balanced - it gives token holders a slight edge without making the game unfair for other players. The head start amount is proportional to your token holdings.</p>
                
                <h2>What is the item shop?</h2>
                <p>The item shop allows you to purchase avatars and other items using your $doodl token supply. You can also use tokens to purchase a head start in games. All tokens received through the item shop or head start purchases are permanently burned, reducing the circulating supply.</p>
                
                <h2>Can I host private games?</h2>
                <p>Yes! You can create your own private games. Private games operate under the same rules and prize distribution mechanisms as public games, with creator fees split equally across all active lobbies (both public and private).</p>
                
                <h2>How does wallet connection work?</h2>
                <p>We use Privy for wallet connection, which is a trusted and secure service. Privy handles all wallet interactions securely. We do not have access to your private keys, seed phrases, or any sensitive wallet information.</p>
                
                <h2>Fair Play & Anti-Cheat</h2>
                <p>We have systems in place to detect and prevent cheating. Suspected cheating may result in score invalidation, bans, or other actions. Please play fairly and respect other players.</p>
                
                <h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
                <p>For the best experience, use Chrome (or Chromium-based browsers) on desktop. Firefox and mobile devices may have limited support.</p>
