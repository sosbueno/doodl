                <p>SK Labs LLC ("Company", "we", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through this Privacy Policy. This policy describes how we collect, use, store, and disclose information from users ("you" or "Player") who access or interact with doodls.fun (the "Platform").</p>
                
                <p>By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.</p>
                
                <h2>1. Platform Overview</h2>
                <p>doodls.fun is a free online multiplayer drawing and guessing game with crypto-integrated prize pools. Players can participate in public games or host private games. 100% of creator fees from the $doodl coin go directly into prize pools, which are distributed to winners (1st, 2nd, and 3rd place) as SOL rewards. Players do not need to pay anything to participate.</p>
                
                <p>The platform operates on blockchain technology for prize distribution. Gameplay data and user interactions are processed to facilitate gameplay, leaderboards, and reward distribution.</p>
                
                <h2>2. Age Restrictions</h2>
                <p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from individuals under 13. If you believe someone underage is using the Platform, please contact us at support@doodls.fun.</p>
