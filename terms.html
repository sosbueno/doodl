                <p>Welcome to doodls.fun, a free online multiplayer drawing and guessing game with crypto-integrated prize pools operated by SK Labs LLC ("Company", "we", or "us"). These Terms of Use ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("you", "user", or "Player") and the Company governing your access to and use of doodls.fun and all related games, services, and interfaces (collectively, the "Platform").</p>
                
                <p><strong>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. BY USING THE PLATFORM, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, YOU MAY NOT USE THE PLATFORM.</strong></p>
                
                <h2>1. Platform Overview</h2>
                <p>doodls.fun is a free-to-play multiplayer drawing and guessing game where players compete for SOL prizes. 100% of creator fees generated by the $doodl coin go directly into prize pools for games. Players do not need to pay anything to participate. Multiple public games run simultaneously, and when games finish, creator fees are automatically claimed and split equally across each lobby. Winners (1st, 2nd, and 3rd place) can claim their SOL prizes.</p>
                
                <h2>2. Beta Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>doodls.fun is currently in active development. The Platform and all associated features may contain bugs, errors, or unexpected behaviors. By using the Platform, you acknowledge:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Platform may experience downtime or unexpected issues.</li>
                    <li>Game results, rewards, and performance may be affected during development.</li>
                    <li>SK Labs LLC is not liable for any data loss, interrupted access, or unrewarded gameplay due to beta-phase instability.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
                <p>By using the Platform, you represent and warrant that you have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</p>
                
                <h2>4. Wallet Connection</h2>
                <p>The Platform uses Privy for wallet connection, which is a trusted and secure service. You are solely responsible for securing your wallet credentials. SK Labs LLC does not store private keys or offer wallet recovery. We do not have access to your wallet information through Privy.</p>
                
                <h2>5. Gameplay and Rewards</h2>
                <p>Games are multiplayer drawing and guessing sessions. Players take turns drawing words while others guess to earn points. The player with the most points wins. Multiple public games run simultaneously. When games finish, creator fees from the $doodl coin are automatically claimed and split equally across each lobby. Winners (1st, 2nd, and 3rd place) can claim their SOL prizes directly to their connected wallet.</p>
                
                <h2>6. Token Holders and Head Start</h2>
                <p>Players who hold $doodl tokens may receive a small head start in points. This advantage is designed to be fair and not create an unfair competitive environment. The head start amount is proportional to token holdings but balanced to maintain game fairness.</p>
                
                <h2>7. Item Shop and Token Burning</h2>
                <p>The Platform features an item shop where users can purchase avatars and other items using their $doodl token supply. Users can also use tokens to purchase a head start in games. All tokens received through the item shop or head start purchases are permanently burned, reducing the circulating supply.</p>
                
                <h2>8. Private Games</h2>
                <p>Users can host their own private games. Private games operate under the same rules and prize distribution mechanisms as public games, with creator fees split equally across all active lobbies.</p>
                
                <h2>9. Blockchain Transparency and Risk</h2>
                <p>Blockchain-based systems are public and immutable. Data written to the blockchain is permanent and viewable by the public. You are responsible for all on-chain interactions, including claiming prizes.</p>
